Get certain data from a tweet
The challenge is to implement which returns us an object containing data from a tweet

We want easy access to the following data

The length of the tweet
The amount of hash tags ( #awesomeNorthcoders ) in the tweet as well as an array of them
The amount of mentions ( @northcoders ) in the tweet as well as an array of them
We only want to return unique hash tags and handles mentioned
examples
You can use these examples to start building up your test suite

    getTweetData("My awesome tweet");
    // -> { tags: [], mentions: [], tagCount: 0, mentionCount: 0, length: 16 }
    getTweetData("My awesome tweet to @northcoders");
    // -> { tags: [], mentions: ["@northcoders"], tagCount: 0, mentionCount: 1, length: 32 }
    getTweetData("My awesome tweet about #coding");
    // -> { tags: [#coding], mentions: [], tagCount: 1, mentionCount: 0, length: 30 }
    getTweetData("My awesome tweet about #coding to @northcoders");
    // -> { tags: [#coding], mentions: [@northcoders], tagCount: 1, mentionCount: 1, length: 46 }
    getTweetData("I am #coding with @northcoders I love #coding and @northcoders");
    // -> { tags: [#coding], mentions: [@northcoders], tagCount: 1, mentionCount: 1, length: 62 }
Extra Tasks
The amount of valid URLS shared in the tweet
The amount of valid email addresses in the tweet
Twitter shrinks all urls by 50%. Take this into account when you return the tweets length
